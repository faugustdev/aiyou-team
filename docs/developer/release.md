# Release And CI/CD Guide

Language: English | [中文](./release.zh-CN.md)

Audience: **developers and maintainers** working on the CrewBee repository. If you only want to install or use CrewBee, start with the [Installation Guide](../guide/installation.md).

## Scope

This guide covers local maintainer workflows, GitHub Actions CI/CD, official releases, npm publishing, and post-release verification. It is not required for normal CrewBee users.

## Goals

CrewBee now supports two parallel flows:

1. **Keep the existing local development pack/install flow** for day-to-day development.
2. **Add a registry publish flow** so OpenCode can load CrewBee from the package name `crewbee`.

This aligns CrewBee with the same **package-name-first** model used by `oh-my-openagent`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["crewbee"]
}
```

When OpenCode supports package-name plugin resolution, that config lets it pull CrewBee from the published npm package automatically.

## Release Model Overview

### 1) Local development flow (preserved)

For local development and verification:

```bash
npm install
npm run pack:local
npm run install:local:user
npm run doctor
```

Artifacts:

- stable local tarball: `.artifacts/local/crewbee-local.tgz`
- OpenCode plugin config entry: `crewbee`

Use this when you are iterating locally and want to test the package before publishing.

### 2) Registry release flow (new)

For official online distribution:

- npm package name: `crewbee`
- OpenCode config plugin entry: `crewbee`
- publish target: npm registry
- release automation: **both local script and GitHub Actions are supported**

---

## Option A: Local Script-Based Release Flow

This path is useful when you want to prepare or manually publish from your own machine.

### Supporting scripts

- `npm run pack:release`
  - builds a versioned tarball in `.artifacts/release/`
- `node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --dryRun`
  - computes next version
  - updates local package files
  - runs `typecheck`, `test`, `doctor`, simulators, `pack:release`, and package smoke
  - **does not publish**
- `node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --publish`
  - does the same validation
  - then runs `npm publish --access public --provenance --tag <tag>`
- Windows wrapper:
  - `scripts\release-registry.bat`

### Recommended local release steps

#### Dry-run / preflight

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --dryRun
```

Or on Windows:

```bat
scripts\release-registry.bat
```

#### Publish patch release

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --publish --bump patch
```

#### Publish minor release

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --publish --bump minor
```

#### Publish explicit version

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --publish --version 0.2.0
```

#### Publish prerelease

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --publish --version 0.2.0-beta.1 --tag beta
```

### What the local release script does

1. Reads current local version.
2. Reads npm registry latest version when available.
3. Computes next version.
4. Updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
5. Runs:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run test`
   - `npm run doctor`
   - `npm run simulate:opencode`
   - `npm run simulate:compact`
   - `npm run pack:release`
   - `npm run smoke:package`
6. Optionally publishes to npm.

> Note: the local publish path requests npm provenance. Some local shells are not recognized by npm as supported provenance providers. If validation and `pack:release` have already passed but npm fails with `Automatic provenance generation not supported for provider: null`, publish the prepared package from the same checked version with `npm publish --access public --tag <tag>` and record the provenance fallback in the release notes / handoff.

### What the local script does **not** do automatically

The local script currently focuses on **package preparation and npm publish**.

After a successful local publish, you should still do the Git steps explicitly:

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes
```

This keeps the local manual path explicit and safe.

---

## Option B: GitHub Actions Release Flow

This is the recommended **official** release path. Humans merge normal feature/fix PRs into `main`, then manually run `release-ci` when a release should happen. After `release-ci` passes, the version bump, tag, npm publish, and GitHub Release happen automatically.

This flow requires `CREWBEE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` to be configured as a repository secret. The token must be allowed to push to `main` and push tags; using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not enough because GitHub suppresses downstream workflows triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes.

### CI workflow

File:

```text
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

It runs:

- `npm ci`
- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run simulate:opencode`
- `npm run simulate:compact`
- `npm run doctor`
- `npm run pack:release`
- packed package smoke via `scripts/smoke-packed-package.mjs`

### CI/CD workflow map

| Workflow | Trigger | Role | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | push to `main`, any pull request | Validate ordinary development changes | Required validation checks |
| `.github/workflows/release-ci.yml` | release PRs, or manual `workflow_dispatch` | Validate release candidates; on manual release, bump version after gates pass | `Release vX.Y.Z` commit on `main` |
| `.github/workflows/release-tag.yml` | push to `main` | Detect version-only release commits and create immutable tags | `vX.Y.Z` tag |
| `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | push of `vX.Y.Z` tag | Publish npm package and create GitHub Release | npm release and GitHub Release |

Normal feature/fix PRs should not change package versions. Maintainers decide when to publish by manually running `release-ci`.

### Release CI workflow

File:

```text
.github/workflows/release-ci.yml
```

Triggers:

- pull requests targeting `main` whose branch starts with `release/v`
- or pull requests targeting `main` with the `release` label
- manual `workflow_dispatch` to validate `main`, bump the package version, and push the release commit

Release PR requirements:

- the PR must come from this repository, not a fork
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the release branch version must match
- the target version must not already exist on npm
- the PR may only change `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

Release CI gates:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run simulate:opencode`
- `npm run simulate:compact`
- `npm run doctor`
- `npm run pack:release`
- packed tarball smoke test
- install local tarball into the OpenCode user-level workspace
- `opencode models --print-logs --log-level DEBUG`
- `opencode agent list --print-logs --log-level DEBUG`

Manual release behavior:

- runs the same release gates on the current `main`
- computes the next version from `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or an explicit version
- updates only `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- commits `Release vX.Y.Z` directly to `main`
- lets `release-tag.yml` create the release tag from that version bump

### Release tag workflow

File:

```text
.github/workflows/release-tag.yml
```

Trigger:

- push to `main`

Behavior:

- if the push to `main` changed `package.json` or `package-lock.json`, validate that both files contain the same release version `X.Y.Z`
- refuse to tag if `crewbee@X.Y.Z` already exists on npm
- create and push tag `vX.Y.Z` when it does not already exist
- pushes that do not change package version files are ignored

### Publish workflow

File:

```text
.github/workflows/publish.yml
```

Trigger:

- push of tag `vX.Y.Z`

### What the publish workflow does

1. Checks out the immutable release tag.
2. Validates that tag, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` versions match.
3. If that npm version is already published, skips `npm publish` and continues with registry smoke, `latest` promotion, latest verification, and GitHub Release creation. This supports rerunning the same tag after a post-publish failure.
4. Runs the full release gates: `typecheck`, tests, build, simulators, doctor, pack, package smoke, and real OpenCode loading smoke.
5. If that npm version is not already published, publishes the verified tarball to a staging dist-tag:
   - stable releases first publish to `next`
   - prereleases publish to their prerelease tag, for example `beta`
6. Fetches the just-published package back from npm and smoke-tests it.
7. For stable releases, promotes `crewbee@X.Y.Z` to `latest`.
8. For stable releases, installs from the registry and reruns OpenCode smoke.
9. Creates a GitHub release with generated notes.

### GitHub Actions release steps

1. Merge normal feature or fix PRs into `main` as usual.
2. When you are ready to publish, manually run the `release-ci` workflow.
3. Choose `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or provide an explicit version.
4. `release-ci` runs the full release gates on `main`.
5. If the gates pass, `release-ci` commits `Release vX.Y.Z` to `main` with only `package.json` and `package-lock.json` changed.
6. `release-tag.yml` detects the package version bump on `main` and creates `vX.Y.Z` automatically.
7. `publish.yml` publishes the tag automatically.
8. After success, verify:
   - npm has `crewbee@<version>`
   - `latest` points to the released stable version
   - tag `v<version>` exists
   - GitHub release exists

The release commit is intentionally version-only. This keeps the release safety boundary while avoiding a hand-written second PR for every feature iteration.

### Manual Explicit Version Release

If a release needs a specific version, do not edit `package.json` by hand, and do not bump to a new version after a publish failure. The standard entry point is still the manual `release-ci` workflow with the `version` input filled in.

GitHub UI steps:

1. Open Actions -> `release-ci` -> Run workflow.
2. Select branch `main`.
3. Set `version` to the target version, for example `0.2.0` or `0.2.0-beta.1`.
4. Leave `bump` at the default `patch`; it is ignored when `version` is provided.
5. Wait for `release-ci`, `release-tag`, and `publish` to complete.

If an Agent should execute the release, give it the version directly, for example:

```text
Please release CrewBee 0.2.0
```

The Agent should run this procedure:

1. Confirm the worktree has no uncommitted release-related changes; do not read or commit `.crewbee/`, `.crewbeectxt/`, or `.local/`.
2. Trigger `release-ci` with `workflow_dispatch`, using `version=<target version>` and `bump=patch`.
3. Wait for `release-ci` to create the `Release v<target version>` commit.
4. Wait for `release-tag.yml` to create the `v<target version>` tag.
5. Wait for `publish.yml` to complete npm publish, `latest` promotion, and GitHub Release creation.
6. Verify `npm view crewbee version`, `npm view crewbee dist-tags --json`, and the GitHub Release.

Failure handling rules:

- If the failure happens before `Publish npm package to staging dist-tag`, fix the workflow or environment and rerun the same tag / workflow. Do not increase the version.
- If `npm publish` succeeded but `latest` promotion, latest verification, or GitHub Release creation failed, fix the workflow or environment and rerun the same tag / workflow. `publish.yml` detects the existing version, skips `npm publish`, and resumes the remaining steps.
- Only choose a new version when you intentionally want to publish a new product version.

## OpenCode Auto-Install Model

After CrewBee is published, the target OpenCode config should reference the package name directly:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["crewbee"]
}
```

### Why this works

CrewBee now writes and validates the canonical plugin entry as:

```text
crewbee
```

instead of a `file://.../opencode-plugin.mjs` path.

This is the same model used by `oh-my-openagent`: the config references the package name, and the host/plugin workspace resolves the published npm package.

### Local fallback

If you are doing development or the package is not yet published, use:

```bash
npm run install:local:user
```

That still installs a local tarball into the OpenCode user-level workspace, but the config entry remains the same canonical package name:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["crewbee"]
}
```

---

## Recommended Operational Policy

### For day-to-day development

Use the preserved local flow:

```bash
npm run install:local:user
```

### For pre-release verification

Use the local release preflight:

```bash
node ./scripts/release-registry.mjs --dryRun
```

### For official releases

Use the manual `release-ci` flow:

```text
workflow_dispatch release-ci -> Release vX.Y.Z commit -> automatic tag -> automatic publish
```

This keeps a single human entry point while preserving an immutable tag as the publish boundary.

## Quick Checklist

Before release:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run doctor`
- `npm run simulate:opencode`
- `npm run simulate:compact`
- `npm run pack:release`
- `npm run smoke:package`

After release:

- npm shows `crewbee@<version>`
- OpenCode config can use `"crewbee"`
- `npm run install:registry:user` succeeds
- `npm run doctor` is healthy
